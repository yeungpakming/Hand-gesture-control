# Hand Gesture Control

This project aims to demonstrate real-time hand detection and tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It processes the output data from MediaPipe to control the computer mouse based on hand movements detected in the live video stream.

## Features

- Live video stream management using OpenCV
- Real-time hand detection and tracking with MediaPipe
- Processing MediaPipe's output data for computer mouse control
- Interactive hand gestures for mouse movements and clicks

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yeungpakming/hand-gesture-control
$ cd hand-gesture-control
```
